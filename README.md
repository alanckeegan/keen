# Keen
Keen is an application for discovering if you have a mutual interest shared with someone, without the cost/risk usually entailed in expressing interest (it's a dark pool for romantic interest).  You sync your contacts, and then can choose to like someone (with an anonymous optional message as well) and they will be notified that they have a like, without knowing the identity of the liker (unless they have also liked you, creating a match).  If you like one of your contacts but they do not have an account on the applicaiton, a Twilio integration will send a message to their phone number from your contact list, informing them that someone on the app knows them and has an interest, and invite them to join.
